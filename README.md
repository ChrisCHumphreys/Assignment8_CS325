## Description
This is my submission for Assignment 9 in CS325.  This program creates a binary search tree, and has methods for
adding and removing terms, finding the smallest and largest terms, updating terms and their values, printing the current
tree, and saving to and reading from files.

It also creates an easy to use intefrace which allows a user to interact with the tree in a simmple way.

## Files Needed
* driver.cpp
* binary_search_tree.cpp
* binary_search_tree.h
* word.cpp
* word.h
* Makefile
* sherlock.txt(optional) - file for reading in and testing
* test.dat(optional) - file for reading in and testing

## How To Run

Assuming you have all files including the optional ones, just make sure you are in the same directory as the files and run `make`. This will build the program. To execute, just type `./binary_tree`. You will be presented with a menu and can follow prompts from that point on.

Included are "sherlock.txt" and "test.dat" files which are text documents for testing.
